## ⚙️ How to compile and run

### 🛠️ Compiling

To compile the project manually, create a build folder, navigate into it, run `cmake ..`,
and then `make` to compile the source code. Alternatively, use the provided build script.
To execute the script, add execute permissions and run:

```
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

### 🚀 Running

If the source code was compile without any issues, you can now run it from the root
directory of the project:

```
./build/examples/example
```
